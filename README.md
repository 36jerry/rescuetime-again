# rescuetime-again
# this is still a presonal project and it's a "alpha" version. 

I am currently busy with other stuff but as soon as I have more time I will complete this project.
The main things to do are: 
* improve UI and UX
* write some documentation/tutorial
* insert control if the uploaded JSON in valid
* improve code readability

This is a personal project which I started mainly with the intention of practicing JS and working with API.
